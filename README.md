# Corners

This is a fork of the [Gemini](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini) theme with corner titles. To use it, include the line `\usetheme{gemini-corners}`.

This fork uses the font [Heebo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo). Note that Heebo does not currently support italics. Sorry.

The color scheme `beamercolorthemecorners.sty` roughly approximates the Google Slides theme "Marina".
